# 🧭 HFT Engineer Track: 90-Day Schedule

## 💡 Core Idea and Ethos

> **The HFT Engineer Track is a disciplined, modular, and performance-driven systems challenge.**  
In 90 days, you’ll **build out a full real-time trading infrastructure**, one tested module at a time.  
Each module is:
- **Composable** — it plugs into other modules.
- **Memory-safe** — no leaks, no undefined behavior.
- **Low-latency** — favor lock-free, zero-copy, and bounded constructs.
- **Observable** — logs, metrics, and debug hooks matter.
- **Professional** — validated by `GTest`, Valgrind, and clean CMake structure.

This track prepares you for the **actual job** of writing and maintaining critical infrastructure at a high-frequency trading firm — **not just passing interviews**.
